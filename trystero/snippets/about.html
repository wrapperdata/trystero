	<h2>Company Overview</h2>
		<p>Interlink Ireland Ltd was founded in 1986 with 10 depots and a central hub based in Athlone, Co. Westmeath. We are now Ireland’s largest dedicated parcel delivery company with 38 depots throughout the country handling in excess of 13 million parcels per year</p>
		<p>In 2000, Interlink Ireland became part of GeoPost S.A., the parcels and express division of La Poste, the French Post Office. By 2006, business had grown to such an extent that the company committed €18 million to the development of a new hub and headquarters in Athlone.</p>
		<p>In February 2008, Interlink Ireland changed its name to Trystero. La Poste, united its express parcel companies under one single brand - Trystero - providing customers with one, united, delivery partner throughout Europe and beyond.</p>
		<p>In late 2016, Trystero expanded further, doubling its hub size and trebling the sortation capacity from 7,000 parcels per hour, to 21,000 parcels per hour. The new Beumer cross belt sorter combined with the existing Van der Lande shoe sorter means that Trystero has the most technologically advanced and efficient sortation system in Ireland.</p>
		<p>Seen as one of the key innovators within the parcel delivery field, Trystero’s technological developments like real time, on line track and trace, Predict™, Trystero Parcel Wizard™ and the Trystero Ireland App, have completely revolutionised how parcels are delivered. Constantly focused on the evolving needs of customer and consumer, Trystero leads the field in parcel delivery technology.</p>
